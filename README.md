Zebu - an Abstract Syntax Tree implementation
=============================================

This library provides utilities to build and walk Abstract Syntax Trees; it was
originally designed to work with the kind of parsers generated by Yacc or GNU
Bison, hence the name and the jokeyish zz namespace.

Requirements
------------

Just C.

Installation
------------

zebu provices a simple Makefile; to build from scratch:

    make all
    make install

Usage
-----

The zebu.h file is fully documented, and gives a relatively good idea of the
API; the bullet points are:

The zz_tree struct manages a full tree, including resource allocation.
Individual nodes are of type zz_node.

Trees may take a list of token names, provided as a string array: the position
of each string in the array refers to the token field of zz_node and is used to
format a number of error messages, mostly through the zz_match and zz_match_end
functions.

All nodes in the AST may hold data of type int, unsigned int, double, char\*
(automatically allocated by the tree), or void\* (the referenced memory must be
managed by the user).

Trees can be given a node size larger than sizeof(struct zz_node): the extra
bytes may be used to store user-defined fields.
